SEO techniques for improving visibility and searchability of the webpage:
1. Optimize meta tags
Meta tags include title, description, and keywords. These tags provide important information to search engines about the content of the webpage. It's important to make sure that these tags are relevant and contain the right keywords that users may search for.
Example:
<head> <title>Arman Ayva | LinkedIn</title> <meta name="description" content="Arman Ayva is a software engineer with expertise in software systems and architecture."> <meta name="keywords" content="Arman Ayva, software engineer, software systems, architecture"> </head>
2. Use proper heading tags
Heading tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.) help search engines understand the structure of the content on the webpage. It's important to use proper heading tags and to include relevant keywords in them.
Example:
<h1>Arman Ayva</h1> <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
3. Include alt tags for images
Alt tags provide alternative text for images and help search engines understand what the image is about. It's important to include relevant keywords in alt tags.
Example:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Arman Ayva Software Engineer">
4. Use descriptive URLs
URLs that are descriptive and contain relevant keywords can help improve search engine visibility.
Example:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/armanayva/software-engineer

5. Use internal linking
Internal linking helps search engines understand the structure of the website and how different pages are related to each other.
Example:

<a href="about.html">About</a>
